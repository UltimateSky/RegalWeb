It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. (gestures for Einstein to get into the car) C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Whoa, whoa, okay. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Right check, Doc. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Well, she's not doing a very good job. (They go to kiss but a woman shoves a flyer in their faces.) Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. (drops a quarter into her collection tin.) Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.</p>
